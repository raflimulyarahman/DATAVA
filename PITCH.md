## 🚀 2-Minute Demo Script

### Opening (0:00-0:15)
"Let me show you how DATAVA turns data into passive income in 3 simple steps."

### Step 1: Upload (0:15-0:45)
"First, I upload a dataset—let's say financial transactions. DATAVA stores it permanently on Walrus decentralized storage. No server can take it down, no company can delete it."

**[Demo: Drag & drop file, show upload progress, display CID]**

### Step 2: Register (0:45-1:15)
"Next, I register ownership with one blockchain transaction. This creates an immutable record that I own this data and deserve rewards when it's used."

**[Demo: Click Register, sign wallet transaction, show transaction hash]**

### Step 3: Earn (1:15-1:45)
"Now watch this—when someone runs AI inference using my dataset, I automatically earn rewards. Look at this real-time dashboard: live transactions, 30-day earnings chart, and a global leaderboard."

**[Demo: Navigate to Rewards Dashboard, show live feed, point to chart, show leaderboard position]**

### Closing (1:45-2:00)
"Three steps. Decentralized storage. Blockchain automation. Real-time rewards. That's DATAVA—where data creators become data earners."
